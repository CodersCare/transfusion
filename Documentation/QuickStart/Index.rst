#. Install this extension:

   .. code-block:: bash

      composer require t3thi/transfusion

#. Configuration:

   -  Since the extension provides an additional feature for the page module, there is nothing special to configure

#. Check the state of translated pages:

   -  Disconnect content of connected mode pages or
   -  Reconnect content of free mode pages or
   -  Either disconnect or reconnect content of mixed mode pages

#. Make sure the connector is green:

   -  When reconnecting content, the goal is to get rid of records in blue, yellow or red columns
